Contributing
======

Ask
------
You _might_ want to submit a [issue](https://github.com/Fsmv/Ep1c-G4m3/issues/new) with the lavel 'Suggestion' first to make sure I'll merge it if you make it.

Code
------
 1. Fork
 2. Branch (`git checkout -b name`)
 3. Commit (`git commit -am "Added..."`)
 4. Push (`git push origin name`)
 5. Make an [issue](https://github.com/Fsmv/Ep1c-G4m3/issues/new) with the label 'Contribution'
 6. Wait; If I like it, I'll merge it.

Join
------
If you would like to make regular contributions message me with the subject 'Contributing to Ep1c G4m3.' We'll go from there and I'll probably add you as a collaborator.
